Colour-Wheel
============

A Little Processing program I made while trying to think of new ways of representing colours. It adds red to the pixels going down from top, green gets added left to right, and the interesting bit comes from the blue which is (255-[Distence from the mouse], plus a little halo effect because it looked cool.
